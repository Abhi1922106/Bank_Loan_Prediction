# Bank_Loan_Prediction
Using Machine learning Algorithms

Content:
This case is about a bank which has a growing customer base. Majority of these
customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of
customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested
in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more
through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of
converting its liability customers to personal loan customers.

Format:
1. ID- Customer ID
2. Age- Customer's age in completed years
3. Experience- #years of professional experience
4. Income- Annual income of the customer ($000)
5. ZIPCode- Home Address ZIP code.
6. Family- Family size of the customer
7. CCAvg- Avg. spending on credit cards per month ($000)
8. Education- Education Level. 1: Undergrad; 2: Graduate; 3: Advanced/Professional
9. Mortgage- Value of house mortgage if any. ($000)
10. Personal Loan- Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last time?
12. Securities Account- Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?
13. CD Account- Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the
bank?
14. Online- Does the customer use internet banking facilities?
15. CreditCard- Does the customer uses a credit card issued by Bank?

TASK:-
Tools Used :- Python.
              Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit learn , Seaborn 

1. Build a model that will help to identify the potential customers who have a higher
   probability of purchasing the loan.
2. Used classification model to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying
   personal loans.
3. Build a decision tree model to identify probability of purchasing loan
